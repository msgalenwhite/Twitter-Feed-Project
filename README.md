# Twitter-Feed-Project


This was a project for week 3 of my programming bootcamp. We were given an image (https://i.imgur.com/L9a4g59.png) and a data file, and asked to recreate it in React.

From the instructions:

1. The finished application should contain the information in the mock-up.
2. When clicking on the reply icon, an alert box should pop up with the text "reply".
3. When clicking on the retweet icon, an alert box should pop up with the text "retweet".
4. When clicking on the like icon, an alert box should pop up with the text "like".
5. When clicking on the more icon, an alert box should pop up with the text "favorite".
6. When the tweet object's favorited property is true, then the like icon should be red.
7. When the tweet object's retweeted property is true, then the retweet icon should be green.
8. If the tweet includes a media entity, remove the corresponding display_url from the tweet text and show the image in the tweet.
9. Front-end developers style their applications. You're a front-end developer. Therefore, you must style your application so it matches the mock-up.
